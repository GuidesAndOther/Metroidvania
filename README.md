This is a devlog/tutorial about a game we're currently working on. The game itself is simple with not less simple style, a fighting/platformer metroidvania game. We're going to post devlogs as we work on the game, and if you're planning on making your own metroidvania, then you're in luck, cause' as I've earlier said, this will also be a tutorial (mainly on the code).
